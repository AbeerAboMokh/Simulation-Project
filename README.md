In this project, we utilized the R programming language to conduct our analysis and statistical tests. The goal was to model a typical workday at the airport, optimizing passenger experience to increase airport preference among travelers.
The analysis involved measuring key metrics such as the average time passengers take to reach the duty-free area (Duty Free) and the ratio of passengers passing through all Duty Free facilities compared to total airport passengers. The initial findings revealed that the average time metric was 0.466, indicating the proportion of passengers enjoying all Duty Free amenities, while the second metric showed an average of 153.882 minutes per passenger.
With a budget of 50,000 shekels, we explored two alternative strategies aimed at improving service levels. The first alternative proposed adding airport staff, a check-in counter, and a security checkpoint. The second alternative involved adding airport staff, a security checkpoint, and additional employees for random checks at Duty Free.
Using the R language, we conducted statistical tests to compare these alternatives and identify the optimal approach that maximizes both metrics. The analysis concluded that the first alternative was the most effective in enhancing passenger experience. Therefore, we recommend this approach to the airport manager for implementation.
